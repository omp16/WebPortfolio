# WebPortfolio
For this project, I created a website of a portfolio of myself. I had a brief "about me" section, projects from this class, and a contact section. I coded a navigation bar at the top of the page which sends the user directly to the section. The goal with this website is to give an overall sense of professionalism and to highlight my adaptability in learning new skills. I want to prove that I can overcome obstacles even with things I don't have experience in, and man, this was difficult for me. Although the project isn't quite where I'd like it, I have a good base for expanding on my portfolio in the future. With no previous coding experience, I think I did an alright job at coding this website through a great deal of time and effort in researching how to code this project. Although I struggled, I feel a sense of accomplishment at having the website completed.
