# WebPortfolio
For this project, I want to create a job portfolio highlighting my skills. I will include some things from my resume - job experience, education, and some skills I have. The goal is to give an overall sense of professionalism, and to highlight my adaptability in learning new skills. I want to prove that I can overcome obstacles even with things I don't have experience in. This project will serve that means, and I will also include the other two main projects from Creating Digital Media. I want to have a separate page linked for my CDM projects, which will likely be a challenge to figure out.
